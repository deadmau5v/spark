If you have trouble with wireguard  https://github.com/deadmau5v/spark?#wireguard-and-spark-
```
If spark cannot connect to server while wireguard is on,
be sure you have added a static route via your main gateway for the ip of spark server.
Else if you forward all the traffic without putting a static route,
you will endup looping your traffic wireguard interface -> spark client -> wireguard interface
If you have trouble making it works on windows, please check this issue #252
